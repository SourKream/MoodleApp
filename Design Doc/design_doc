We have designed a user friendly moodle android app. Our app had some added features to enhance the user comfort and ease of usage.

\section{User Interface}
The UI of the app comprises of six different activities alongwith six fragments. The details of different activities are as follow:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Login Activity : On clicking the app icon this activity is invoked where user credentials are asked.\\

\section{Implementation Details}

%Organization of user information (Is it in a special User class, or is it distributed in arrays for each user entry)

%(@Shantanu & Surag)Add Networking Details and the optimizations done!
\begin{itemize}
\item At the login activity the user credentials are validated by sending the request to the server and checking the response. In case of invalid login, proper message is displayed.\\
\item In order to send the request to server to fetch the particular data a common networking class is built which has functions to  returns the json response for the particular request.\\
\item In the main activity all the data regarding the registered courses, notifications and overall grades is loaded into the list-arrays. \\
\item Details about the particular course is loaded when the user clicks on the particular list. Some networking optimizations have been done to avoid the repeated server requests.\\
\item Different classes are built for effective sharing and storage of data through inheritance among various classes.\\
%Add other features 
\end{itemize}
